### What FriendFiesta is all about:Â 
FriendFiesta is a planner for your next nightout with your friends. Here you can find a date via datefinder for multiple users, suggest some nice plan (where to eat, drink, etc.) and then everyone can vote on the plan. In the end, after voting, everyone is going to be presented with the final plan (most votes).

To start the develepmont environment just execute the vs code dev container.
